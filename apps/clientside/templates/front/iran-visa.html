You are allowed to import 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, and a “reasonable quantity” of perfume duty-free. Alcohol, pork, and porn are strictly illegal and should not be brought in.<br>
You can bring in pretty much any book as long as the cover doesn’t show too much female skin or hair.<br>
You can bring in your laptop, smartphone, shortwave radio, iPad, or video equipment if they don’t look too professional. Technically you have to declare if you have more than 1,000 USD in cash, but few do, and the officials rarely check.</span>

You can bring a “reasonable number” of rugs with you as long as the total value doesn’t exceed 160 USD. Save your receipts as proof of purchase. Shopkeepers will undervalue the items on receipts issued to foreigners so that they will be able to export more carpets.<br>
You can take up to 150 g of gold and 3 Kg of silver, without any precious gemstones. Anything over that and you have to get an export permit from the Iranian Customs Office.<br>
US sanctions mean that you technically can’t take more than 100 USD worth of Iranian goods into the US.</span></li>

You will need 2-3 passport photos, 2 copies of identification pages of your passport, your current Iran Tourist Visa, your entry stamp/paperwork, any previous extensions, 2 copies of your visa extension form, and at least 1,000,000 IRR for the extension fee along with any additional fees for forms/printing/etc. (Photocopiers can usually be found in each location).<br>
Go to the nearest Melli Bank Melli branch (usually on-site or nearby), tell the bank staff visa and they will fill the forms for you. Pay the fee, return to the office with your bank receipt and visa extension.<br>
Your visa extension should be issued within 1-3 hours, however, in the case of less reliable cities, the process may take up to 3-7 days.</span>
